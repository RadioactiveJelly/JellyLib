### Installation

This mod requires BepInEx to run. To ensure stability, please install the latest 5.x.x version  of BepInEx. Using BepInEx 6 will not work.

You may find BepInEx (and how to install it) [here](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx).

Once BepInEx is installed, run the game once. Afterwards, place the JellyLib.dll into the plugins folder. When you run the game, check the top right corner of the main menu. If the indicator is present, then the mod successfully installed.
